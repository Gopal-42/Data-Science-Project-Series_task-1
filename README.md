# Domain: DATA SCIENCE 

## Aim
The aim of this project is to predict stock market prices using machine learning techniques in Python. We utilize historical stock market data to train and evaluate models, ultimately aiming to provide accurate predictions of future stock prices.

## Libraries
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- tensorflow/keras (optional for deep learning)

## Dataset
we download dataset from keggle.com


## Data Processing
Data processing involves cleaning, handling missing values, and adding features:
python
import pandas as pd

def preprocess_data(file_path):
    data = pd.read_csv(file_path)
    data = data.dropna().reset_index(drop=True)
    data['MA50'] = data['Close'].rolling(window=50).mean()
    data['MA200'] = data['Close'].rolling(window=200).mean()
    return data

# Example usage
data = preprocess_data('data/AAPL_data.csv')

## Model Training
We train machine learning models such as Linear Regression using the preprocessed data:
python
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression

def build_model(data):
    X = data[['MA50', 'MA200']]
    y = data['Close']
    X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)
    model = LinearRegression()
    model.fit(X_train, y_train)
    return model, X_test, y_test

# Example usage
model, X_test, y_test = build_model(data)


## Conclusion
This project demonstrates how to predict stock market prices using Python and machine learning techniques. By following the outlined steps, one can collect, preprocess, and analyze stock market data, train models, and make predictions.
